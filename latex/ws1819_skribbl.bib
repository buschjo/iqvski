abstract = {Sketcher is a simple tool that uses CNN to recognize drawings. The CNN was trained to recognize 100 classes using the quick draw dataset. It achieves 6{\%} top 5 error. The accuracy could be improved but I focused on making the model light with around 1 million parameters. The table will show the top 5 predictions.},
